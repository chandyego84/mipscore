## Stages
1. Instruction Fetch
2. Instruction Decode
3. Execution
4. Memory Access
5. Write-back

## Operations Implemented
- add
- addi
- addu
- sub
- subu
- and
- or
- sll
- srl
- slt
- lw
- sw
- beq
- bne
- j

## TODO
- Hard: Make the single-cycle MIPS architecture.
- VERY Hard: Re-write the architecture to make pipelining work.
